            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The owner of a local bakery wanted me to create an app for her store. The goal was to make it more
                convenient and
                easier for her customers to create orders.</p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>Being that I was the only designer on this project, I handled all the research and UI design.</p>

            <h2>Initial User Research</h2>
            <p>For the initial research, I got to know my client’s business. It’s a bakery that specializes in cake
                pops. It’s owned by an independent business woman and single mom. Her target audience is mostly female.
                Although her main competition is the few other bakeries located in her town, none of them specialize in
                cake pops. So I studied some of her online competitors, to get a feel for what they are doing as well.
                In the initial research stage, I discovered that many of the people that purchase cake pops are women,
                particularly moms. So I created a user-persona based on that knowledge. The user persona I came up with
                is a 34 year old stay-at-home mom, named Jackie. She has a bachelors degree in sociology and loves yoga,
                gardening and crafting. She has a 2 year old son that is her whole world. Jackie loves cake pops and is
                looking to have something fun, unique and different to serve at her son’s 2 year birthday party.</p>

        <h2>Design Approach</h2>
        <p>With the user and the business in mind, I started by creating a user flow map for our persona, Jackie.
            After
            figuring out how Jackie was going to move through the app, I created a wireframe to give the client an
            idea
            on how the app was going to work.

            I also created a moodboard and sent it to her to make sure we were on the same page, as far as
            aesthetics
            go. Once I got the okay from her, I started designing.</p>

        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>I ran both moderated and unmoderated user tests for this app. Upon initial testing, some of the users were
            having a difficult time figuring out how to use the category slider. However, I was able to quickly make
            adjustments and fixed that issue. After that, all of the users had no problems navigating through the tasks
            I gave them. All of the users were able confidently make a purchase on the app.</p>
