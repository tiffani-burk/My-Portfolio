        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Manooth Furniture is a brand new business, selling affordable, high-end furniture, made in Ireland. This was
            a project for my Adobe XD class, led by Adobe-certified instructor, Daniel Scott.
        </p>



        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>To build an e-commerce website and app for people to browse and purchase furniture for home delivery. The
            website should include: 1. Homepage (With a Nav {Living Room, Bedroom, Kitchen, Dining Room}, Hero Slider,
            New in Store, Inspiration Ideas, Clearance and a Footer) 2. Category Page and 3. Product Page</p>
    </section>

        <h2>My Role </h2>
        <p>As a student, my role was to create this entire website from the ground up, as well as a full app. I created
            wireframes, prototypes, mockups and ran usability tests.
        </p>

        <h2>Initial User Research</h2>
        <p>Since this was a brand new website, no existing data was available. However, since it is from an existing
            field, I was able to locate data online that applied to our users. Based on that data, I created a user
            persona for Manooth Furniture. I continued to keep that user persona in mind for every decision that I made
            for Manooth Furniture.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Design Approach</h2>
        <p>I wanted to start building the website first and the app second, so to keep the theme and user experience of
            the two quite similar. I approach all my designs with three main objectives, to make them useful, usable and
            valuable. First, I focused on strategy, to find out what the business wanted, what the stakeholders wanted
            and what the users wanted. I, then, created and prioritized an informational architecture outline. I decided
            the “hierarchy tree” was the best information architecture model for displaying our information, since this
            was going to be a content heavy e-commerce website. When creating my wireframe, I separated items of less
            visual heirachry from those of higher importance using contrast. Going into this, I wanted to keep core
            principles of Interaction Design, such as; consistency, visibility, predictability, learnability and
            feedback at the forefront of my design process.</p>

        <h2>Final Navigation Experience</h2>
        <p>I started with a sliding hero image to get the user’s attention. I kept the home page simple, using drop down
            menus to guide the user to their perceived destination.</p>

    <section>
        <p>On the product page, I added an interactive design, by making the star ratings pushable and the add to cart
            button and favorite button interactive.
