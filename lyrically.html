            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <div class="portfolio-item-individual">
                <p>Lyrically was my frontend development capstone project at Nashville Software School. The objective of
                    this
                    was to build a functioning app in React.js that allows the user to create, read and destroy. I also
                    took
                    the
                    initiative collect data and conduct user interviews to create a case study before developing this
                    application. Below, I have detailed my design process and included video a walkthrough of my
                    developed
                    application.</p>

            <h3>What need does this fill?</h3>
            <p>When songwriters gig, they are often required to add cover songs (other peopleâ€™s songs) to their setlists
                of
                original material in order to get paid. Currently, there are apps to create setlists for cover songs and
                there
                are apps to create setlists for original songs, but there are no apps that allow the user to combine
                both
                covers
                and original material. So musicians often have to switch between multiple apps while gigging and
                rehearsing.
                I
                designed Lyrically as a solution to this problem.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>To create an app that bridges the gab between digital setlists aimed at songwriters and those
                        marketed to
                        cover
                        bands.</p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>To provide a way for musicians to store their music for both covers and original songs in one place,
                while
                being
                able to easily arrange and change setlists. </p>

            <h3>Insights</h3>
            <p>The potential users of Lyrically had indicated that while they were content with the ease of use of the
                current
                competitive apps, they were unhappy that they were unable to store a variety of song types, such as
                cover
                songs
                and original songs.</p>

            <h3>Client Goals & Contraints</h3>
            <p>The two biggest constraints of this project were time and money. Due to a limited budget, I was only able
                to
                attain two user interviews, therefore not retrieving as much data and user input as I would have liked.
                The
                other constraint was time. Due to the limited time constraint, I was not able to do usability testing.

            <p>After studying some of the brands that the users relate to, I noticed that several had black in them.
                Therefore I decided to brand Lyrically with black and purple.
