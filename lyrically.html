        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Lyrically was my frontend development capstone project at Nashville Software School. The objective of this
            was to build a functioning app in React.js that allows the user to create, read and destroy. I also took the
            initiative collect data and conduct user interviews to create a case study before developing this
            application. Below, I have detailed my design process and included video a walkthrough of my developed
            application.</p>

    <h3>What need does this fill?</h3>
    <p>When songwriters gig, they are often required to add cover songs (other peopleâ€™s songs) to their setlists of
        original material in order to get paid. Currently, there are apps to create setlists for cover songs and there
        are apps to create setlists for original songs, but there are no apps that allow the user to combine both covers
        and original material. So musicians often have to switch between multiple apps while gigging and rehearsing. I
        designed Lyrically as a solution to this problem.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I am the creator, designer and developer of this app.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>To create an app that bridges the gab between digital setlists aimed at songwriters and those marketed to
            cover
            bands.</p>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>To provide a way for musicians to store their music for both covers and original songs in one place, while being
        able to easily arrange and change setlists. </p>

    <h3>Research Synthesis</h3>

    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <p>The potential users of Lyrically had indicated that while they were content with the ease of use of the current
        competitive apps, they were unhappy that they were unable to store a variety of song types, such as cover songs
        and original songs.</p>

    <h3>Client Goals & Contraints</h3>
    <p>The two biggest constraints of this project were time and money. Due to a limited budget, I was only able to
        attain two user interviews, therefore not retrieving as much data and user input as I would have liked. The
        other constraint was time. Due to the limited time constraint, I was not able to do usability testing.</p>
