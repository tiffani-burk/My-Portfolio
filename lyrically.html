    <!-- Intro -->

    <section class="intro-section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Lyrically was my frontend development capstone project at Nashville Software School. The objective of
            this
            was to build a functioning app in React.js that allows the user to create, read and destroy. I also
            took
            the
            initiative collect data and conduct user interviews to create a case study before developing this
            application. Below, I have detailed my design process and included video a walkthrough of my
            developed
            application.</p>

        <h2>What need does this fill?</h2>
        <p>When songwriters gig, they are often required to add cover songs (other peopleâ€™s songs) to their setlists
            of
            original material in order to get paid. Currently, there are apps to create setlists for cover songs and
            there
            are apps to create setlists for original songs, but there are no apps that allow the user to combine
            both
            covers
            and original material. So musicians often have to switch between multiple apps while gigging and
            rehearsing.
            I
            designed Lyrically as a solution to this problem.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>To create an app that bridges the gab between digital setlists aimed at songwriters and those
                    marketed to
                    cover
                    bands.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>To provide a way for musicians to store their music for both covers and original songs in one place,
            while
            being
            able to easily arrange and change setlists. </p>

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <p>The potential users of Lyrically had indicated that while they were content with the ease of use of the
            current
            competitive apps, they were unhappy that they were unable to store a variety of song types, such as
            cover
            songs
            and original songs.</p>

        <h2>Client Goals & Contraints</h2>
        <p>The two biggest constraints of this project were time and money. Due to a limited budget, I was only able
            to
            attain two user interviews, therefore not retrieving as much data and user input as I would have liked.
            The
            other constraint was time. Due to the limited time constraint, I was not able to do usability testing.
